        <h2>高峯 翠 (Takamine Midori)</h2>
        <p><strong>CV:</strong> Watanabe Takumi<br />
        <strong>Unit:</strong> Ryuseitai</p>

        <p>Midori is a once-reluctant idol with a shy, withdrawn personality. He tends to avoid conflict and often hides behind others, but has been growing steadily thanks to his teammates and the support of gentle mascots. Known for his calm singing voice and love for vegetables and animals, Midori is surprisingly skilled at market haggling and caring for plants.</p>

        <p>A member of <em>Starmaker Production</em>'s <strong>Ryuseitai</strong>, he represents the green star. Though uncertain at times, Midori continues working to find his place and values those who help him shine.</p>
